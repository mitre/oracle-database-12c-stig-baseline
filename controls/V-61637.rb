  title "The DBMS must produce audit records containing sufficient information
  to establish the outcome (success or failure) of the events."
  desc "Information system auditing capability is critical for accurate
  forensic analysis. Audit record content that may be necessary to satisfy the
  requirement of this control includes, but is not limited to: timestamps, source
  and destination IP addresses, user/process identifiers, event descriptions,
  application specific events, success/fail indications, file names involved,
  access control, or flow control rules invoked.

      Success and failure indicators ascertain the outcome of a particular event.
  As such, they also provide a means to measure the impact of an event and help
  authorized personnel to determine the appropriate response. Without knowing the
  outcome of audit events, it is very difficult to accurately recreate the series
  of events during forensic analysis.

  that the DBMS is configured to use Oracle's auditing features, or that a
  third-party product or custom code is deployed and configured to satisfy this
  requirement.

  If a third-party product or custom code is used, compare its current
  configuration with the audit requirements. If any of the requirements is not
  covered by the configuration, this is a finding.

  The remainder of this Check is applicable specifically where Oracle auditing is
  in use.

  If Standard Auditing is used:
  To see if Oracle is configured to capture audit data, enter the following
  SQL*Plus command:

  SHOW PARAMETER AUDIT_TRAIL

  or the following SQL query:

  SELECT * FROM SYS.V$PARAMETER WHERE NAME = 'audit_trail';

  If Oracle returns the value 'NONE', this is a finding.

  To confirm that Oracle audit is capturing sufficient information to establish
  outcomes, perform a successful auditable action and an auditable action that
  results in an SQL error, and then view the results in the SYS.AUD$ table or the
  audit file, whichever is in use.

  If no return code or other outcome information is returned for the auditable
  action just performed, this is a finding.

  If error is indicated for the successful action, this is a finding. If no error
  is indicated for the unsuccessful action, this is a finding.

  If Unified Auditing is used:
  To see if Oracle is configured to capture audit data, enter the following
  SQL*Plus command:

  SELECT * FROM V$OPTION WHERE PARAMETER = 'Unified Auditing';

  If Oracle returns the value \"TRUE\", this is not a finding.

  To confirm that Oracle audit is capturing sufficient information to establish
  outcomes, perform a successful auditable action and an auditable action that
  results in an SQL error, and then view the results in the
  SYS.UNIFIED_AUDIT_TRAIL view.

  If no return code or other outcome information is returned for the auditable
  action just performed, this is a finding.

  If error is indicated for the successful action, this is a finding.

  If no error is indicated for the unsuccessful action, this is a finding."
  tag "fix": "Configure the DBMS's auditing to audit standard and
  organization-defined auditable events, the audit record to include the outcome.
  If preferred, use a third-party or custom tool.

  If using a third-party product, proceed in accordance with the product
  documentation. If using Oracle's capabilities, proceed as follows.

  If Standard Auditing is used:
  Use this process to ensure auditable events are captured:

  ALTER SYSTEM SET AUDIT_TRAIL=<audit trail type> SCOPE=SPFILE;

  Audit trail type can be 'OS', 'DB', 'DB,EXTENDED', 'XML' or 'XML,EXTENDED'.
  After executing this statement, it may be necessary to shut down and restart
  the Oracle database.

  If unified Auditing is used:
  To ensure auditable events are captured:
  Link the oracle binary with uniaud_on, and then restart the database.
