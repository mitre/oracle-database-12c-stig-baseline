  title "The DBMS must ensure remote sessions that access an
  organization-defined list of security functions and security-relevant
  information are audited."
  desc "Remote access is any access to an organizational information system by
  a user (or an information system) communicating through an external,
  non-organization-controlled network (e.g., the Internet). Examples of remote
  access methods include dial-up, broadband, and wireless.

      Remote network and system access is accomplished by leveraging common
  communication protocols to establish a remote connection. These connections
  will typically originate over either the public Internet or the Public Switched
  Telephone Network (PSTN). Neither of these internetworking mechanisms is
  private or secure and they do not by default restrict access to networked
  resources once connectivity is established.

      Numerous best practices are employed to protect remote connections, such as
  utilizing encryption to protect data sessions and firewalls to restrict and
  control network connectivity. In addition to these protections, auditing must
  also be utilized in order to track system activity, assist in diagnosing system
  issues, and provide evidence needed for forensic investigations after a
  security incident.

      When organizations define security-related application functions or
  security-related application information, it is incumbent upon the application
  providing access to that data to ensure auditing of remote connectivity to
  those resources occurs in support of organizational requirements

      Remote access to security functions (e.g., user management, audit log
  management, etc.) and security-relevant information requires the activity be
  audited by the organization. Any application providing remote access must
  support organizational requirements to audit access or organization-defined
  security functions and security-relevant information.

      Database security features accessed through remote methods must be audited
  to ensure the access is authorized and appropriate.

  tag "check": "Verify, using vendor and system documentation if necessary,
  that the DBMS is configured to use Oracle's auditing features, or that a
  third-party product or custom code is deployed and configured to satisfy this
  requirement.

  If a third-party product or custom code is used, compare its current
  configuration with the audit requirements. If any of the requirements is not
  covered by the configuration, this is a finding.

  The remainder of this Check is applicable specifically where Oracle auditing is
  in use.

  If Standard Auditing is used:
  To see if Oracle is configured to capture audit data, enter the following
  SQL*Plus command:
  SHOW PARAMETER AUDIT_TRAIL
  or the following SQL query:
  SELECT * FROM SYS V$PARAMETER WHERE NAME = 'audit_trail';
  select value from v$parameter where name='audit_trail';
  If Oracle returns the value 'NONE', this is a finding.

  To confirm that Oracle audit is capturing information on the required events,
  review the contents of the SYS.AUD$ table or the audit file, whichever is in
  use. If auditable events are not listed, this is a finding.

  If Unified Auditing is used:
  To see if Oracle is configured to capture audit data, enter the following
  SQL*Plus command:
  SELECT * FROM V$OPTION WHERE PARAMETER = 'Unified Auditing';
  If Oracle returns the value 'TRUE', this is not a finding.

  To confirm that Oracle audit is capturing information on the required events,
  review the contents of the SYS.UNIFIED_AUDIT_TRAIL view. If auditable events
  are not listed, this is a finding."
  tag "fix": "Configure the DBMS's auditing to audit organization-defined
  auditable events. If preferred, use a third-party tool. The tool must provide
  the minimum capability to audit the required events.

  If using a third-party product, proceed in accordance with the product
  documentation. If using Oracle's capabilities, proceed as follows.

  If Standard Auditing is used:
  Use this process to ensure auditable events are captured:
  ALTER SYSTEM SET AUDIT_TRAIL=<audit trail type> SCOPE=SPFILE;
  Audit trail type can be 'OS', 'DB', 'DB,EXTENDED', 'XML' or 'XML,EXTENDED'.
  After executing this statement, it may be necessary to shut down and restart
  the Oracle database.

  If the site-specific audit requirements are not covered by the default audit
  options, deploy and configure Fine-Grained Auditing.  For details, refer to
  Oracle documentation at the locations below.

  If Unified Auditing is used:
  Use this process to ensure auditable events are captured:
  Link the oracle binary with uniaud_on, and then restart the database. Oracle
  Database Upgrade Guide describes how to enable unified auditing.
