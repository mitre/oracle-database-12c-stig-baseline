  title "The DBMS must provide audit record generation capability for
  organization-defined auditable events within the database."
  desc "Audit records can be generated from various components within the
  information system. (e.g., network interface, hard disk, modem, etc.). From an
  application perspective, certain specific application functionalities may be
  audited as well.

      The list of audited events is the set of events for which audits are to be
  generated. This set of events is typically a subset of the list of all events
  for which the system is capable of generating audit records (i.e., auditable
  events, timestamps, source and destination addresses, user/process identifiers,
  event descriptions, success/fail indications, file names involved, and access
  control or flow control rules invoked).

      Organizations define which application components shall provide auditable
  events.

      The DBMS must provide auditing for the list of events defined by the
  organization or risk negatively impacting forensic investigations into
  malicious behavior in the information system. Audit records can be generated
  from various components within the information system, such as network
  interfaces, hard disks, modems, etc. From an application perspective, certain
  specific application functionalities may be audited, as well.

      The list of audited events is the set of events for which audits are to be
  generated. This set of events is typically a subset of the list of all events
  for which the system is capable of generating audit records (i.e., auditable
  events, timestamps, source and destination addresses, user/process identifiers,
  event descriptions, success/fail indications, file names involved, and access
  control or flow control rules invoked).

      Organizations may define the organizational personnel accountable for
  determining which application components shall provide auditable events.

      Auditing provides accountability for changes made to the DBMS configuration
  or its objects and data. It provides a means to discover suspicious activity
  and unauthorized changes. Without auditing, a compromise may go undetected and
  without a means to determine accountability.

      The Department of Defense has established the following as the minimum set
  of auditable events. Most can be audited via Oracle settings; some - marked
  here with an asterisk - cannot, and may require OS settings.
      - Successful and unsuccessful attempts to access, modify, or delete
  privileges, security objects, security levels, or categories of information
  (e.g. classification levels).
      - Successful and unsuccessful logon attempts, privileged activities or
  other system level access
      - Starting and ending time for user access to the system, concurrent logons
  from different workstations.
      - Successful and unsuccessful accesses to objects.
      - All program initiations.
      - *All direct access to the information system.
      - All account creations, modifications, disabling, and terminations.
      - *All kernel module loads, unloads, and restarts.

  that the DBMS is configured to use Oracle's auditing features, or that a

  If a third-party product or custom code is used, compare its current
  configuration with the audit requirements. If any of the requirements is not
  covered by the configuration, this is a finding.

  The remainder of this Check is applicable specifically where Oracle auditing is
  in use.

  If Standard Auditing is used:
  To see if Oracle is configured to capture audit data, enter the following
  SQL*Plus command:
  SHOW PARAMETER AUDIT_TRAIL
  or the following SQL query:
  SELECT * FROM SYS.V$PARAMETER WHERE NAME = 'audit_trail';
  If Oracle returns the value 'NONE', this is a finding.

  To confirm that Oracle audit is capturing information on the required events,
  review the contents of the SYS.AUD$ table or the audit file, whichever is in
  use. If auditable events are not listed, this is a finding.

  If Unified Auditing is used:
  To see if Oracle is configured to capture audit data, enter the following
  SQL*Plus command:
  SELECT * FROM V$OPTION WHERE PARAMETER = 'Unified Auditing';
  If Oracle returns the value 'TRUE', this is not a finding.

  To confirm that Oracle audit is capturing information on the required events,
  review the contents of the SYS.UNIFIED_AUDIT_TRAIL view. If auditable events
  are not listed, this is a finding."
  tag "fix": "Configure the DBMS's auditing to audit organization-defined
  auditable events. If preferred, use a third-party tool. The tool must provide
  the minimum capability to audit the required events.

  If using a third-party product, proceed in accordance with the product
  documentation. If using Oracle's capabilities, proceed as follows.

  If Standard Auditing is used:
  Use this process to ensure auditable events are captured:
  ALTER SYSTEM SET AUDIT_TRAIL=<audit trail type> SCOPE=SPFILE;
  Audit trail type can be 'OS', 'DB', 'DB,EXTENDED', 'XML' or 'XML,EXTENDED'.
  After executing this statement, it may be necessary to shut down and restart
  the Oracle database.

  If the site-specific audit requirements are not covered by the default audit
  options, deploy and configure Fine-Grained Auditing.  For details, refer to
  Oracle documentation at the locations below.

  If Unified Auditing is used:
  Use this process to ensure auditable events are captured:
  Link the oracle binary with uniaud_on, and then restart the database. Oracle
  Database Upgrade Guide describes how to enable unified auditing.
